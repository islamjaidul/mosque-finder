Such a rare opportunity is rarely available and will likely not be seen again as St Mary's Avenue is Wanstead's most desirable and sought after road. Tree-lined and edged with large, impressive homes situated on large plots, residents are well connected with Epping Forest, Wanstead High Street and Wanstead station all within close proximity. Currently the plot is occupied by a four bedroom detached bungalow in need of cosmetic updating, with two bathrooms, two separate toilets, kitchen/diner with separate utility room, large lounge and integral garage. The garden is a fantastic size and there is a deep drive with off road parking to the front for several vehicles.&nbsp;<br><br>Planning permission has been fully approved and plans drawn up for the current dwelling to be demolished in favour of an impressive six bedroom, four storey home, with the lower storey being set beneath ground level. If the buyer were to carry out the approved plans they would be able to create a huge home in an idyllic location. Upon entering the home you would be presented with an impressive entrance hall which would lead to a grand formal reception, home cinema room, a shower room and store area and huge open plan living area to the rear boasting a study space, lounge, kitchen/diner and large walk-in pantry. The large bi-fold door leading from the living area would allow you to access a raised paved patio area with plenty of entertainment and seating space and a view of the sunken courtyard below.<br><br>To the first floor there would be three spacious double bedrooms, all with en-suite facilities, and a large store cupboard leading off of the landing area. Both the master suite and bedroom two to this floor would have space to accommodate a seating area in the main bedroom and enjoy the benefit of a generous walk-in-wardrobe. To the third floor the remaining three bedrooms and office would be found, with one bedroom benefitting from an en-suite and the remaining two bedrooms sharing a large bathroom with separate bath and shower.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, the home has planning for an exceptional basement area, allowing the property to stand apart from those generally found in the area. A car lift would provide the ability to securely store two cars, whist the remaining space would be occupied by a gym, spa area, W.C, storage and plant area and large entertaining space and bar area that would overlook and enjoy access to a sunken courtyard.&nbsp;</p>",

The above price is for guidance only. It is based on our average discount and would be the estimated price payable by a 69-year-old single male.

    "full_description": "<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A substantial, elegantly appointed four bedroom semi detached, in our ever popular Warren Estate neighborhood of broad sweeping avenues surrounded by natural green spaces. With Wanstead High Street, the heart of this increasingly popular East London village, less than a half mile on foot.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As generous as the property is, there's scope for further development with the loft space so far unconverted. Subject to the usual permissions you could, as your neighbours have, add a whole extra storey to this already grand property, making this an uncommonly good investment.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">IF YOU LIVED HERE...</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">You'll be stretching out in almost 1500 square feet of impeccably finished living space, with the front reception alone coming in at 220 square feet, all bright and brimming with vintage touches from the ceiling rose and cornicing overhead to the original floorboards underfoot. Your separate dining room is still more spacious, a hair under 300 square feet artfully separated by a bespoke fretwork arch.&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Double patio doors lead out into the sixty foot, south facing rear garden. An elegantly landscaped affair, it begins with a generous patio - ideal for barbecues and al fresco dining of all kinds – before descending to an immaculate length of lawn flanked by paths, raised beds and timber fencing. There's a beautiful central bed with a rose arch before it ends in a second patio with a pair of sheds. An amazing space.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Back inside and the ground floor is completed by a spare WC and laundry room, plus the kitchen, decked out in a smart timber suite. Head upstairs (past some gorgeous vintage stained glass) and you have a large landing with plenty of fitted storage. The capacious master bedroom comes in at over 200 square feet, with more original timber underfoot. Bedrooms two and three are both solid doubles of 100 and 130 square feet respectively, both with leafy garden views.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bedroom four is a generous single of 90 square feet, ideal for a child, home office or dressing room while, finally, the family bathroom is an elegant, understated affair in pale grey, with a tub and separate shower cubicle. Outside, Wanstead tube station is less than a half mile on foot and will whisk you directly into Liverpool Street in just eighteen minutes via the Central Line.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Effra-Regular, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Once a royal hunting ground and the favoured country retreat of Henry VIII, Wanstead's rural past is still apparent in its multitude of open green spaces, from Epping Forest to Wanstead Flats.

They have all all since fled the nest and we feel that our home is ready to welcome a new family. My husband is a very keen gardener and we had lorry loads of topsoil delivered to allow him to grow our own vegetables which the south facing garden lends itself to. We have wonderful neighbours and we shall miss them but take away fond memories of our time here.

Set on the tree lined Richmond Way, this substantial home offers beautifully maintained period features alongside contemporary living and layout. Stepping inside the ornate hallway you will discover a large lounge, dining room and an airy kitchen, which enjoys views over the garden. The spacious lounge provides a beautiful place to relax in thanks to the tasteful decor and the room's focal points, such as the feature fireplace, large bay window and characterful detailing of the cornicing and skirting boards. The dining room is equally as impressive with double aspect views over the garden and a kitchen, which has plenty of storage and work surface space. With these two rooms connecting seamlessly, it creates a fantastic entertaining space. Although these three rooms create a large, 'open plan' sense of living, there is also the addition of a separate reception room that features the stunning turret and bay window overlooking Wanstead flats and creates a peaceful area to escape to and could be used as a formal dining room or second TV room if desired. There is also a large handy cellar, which is accessible from the hallway and provides ideal storage space. To the first floor there is a modern family bathroom and four bedrooms, with the stunning master bedroom enjoying a large bay window and a great deal of space.<br><br>Externally, the advantage of the corner position allows the rear garden to wrap around the house and has been thoughtfully designed to create three distinct areas: a large raised decked area, perfect for hosting BBQ's or summer parties, a spacious artificial grassed area, which is perfect for the children to play on and a beautiful oasis of mature shrubs and plants, providing the perfect shady retreat. The icing on the cake with this home is the large double garage at the rear of the garden that has been converted to provide a large useable space with electricity, which depending on your needs could be used as a play room, office, gym, or a summer house.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>SITTING</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>22'3 into bay x 11'9 (6.78m x 3.58m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>DRAWING</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>18' 1\" into bay x 12' 4\" (5.51m x 3.76m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>DINING</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>13' 6\" x 11' 2\" (4.11m x 3.4m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>KITCHEN</strong>&nbsp;<strong>13' 6\" x 6' 8\" (4.11m x 2.03m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>CELLAR</strong>&nbsp;<strong>21' 11\" x 18' 10\" (6.68m x 5.74m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ONE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>18' 2\" into bay x 12' 4\" (5.54m x 3.76m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>TWO</strong>&nbsp;<strong>13' 8\" x 9' 8\" (4.17m x 2.95m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>THREE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>12' 9\" x 9' 8\" (3.89m x 2.95m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>FOUR</strong>&nbsp;<strong>8' 7\" x 6' 10\" (2.62m x 2.08m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BATHROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>9' 4\" x 6' 3\" (2.84m x 1.91m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

The home is close to Wanstead Flats, Wanstead Park and Aldersbrook Primary School, which is rated outstanding by Ofsted. The property is also equidistant from Wanstead Station (1.2 miles), Wanstead Park Station (1.2 miles) and Manor Park Station (1.1 mile) which is due to enjoy cross-rail later on in the year.<br><br>Perched on the end of Park Road, the property has a feeling of space around it thanks to Wanstead Park being a stone's throw from the front door. The Park is a wonderful place to enjoy all year round, with picturesque walks, ornamental lakes and a tea hut serving hot beverages, snacks and ice creams. The home itself offers a great deal of space throughout and this is particularly evident in the grand lounge/diner. The wooden floor continues through to the breakfast room, which can easily be used as a further reception/playroom, leading into the contemporary kitchen area to the rear. The space could be further opened up to create a larger family dining/kitchen area if desired.<br><br>To the first floor there is a family bathroom and four bedrooms, three of which are generous doubles with the fourth a good office/single bedroom or nursery. The loft has been converted to create a further double bedroom with a handy en-suite bathroom. To the rear there is a large, low maintenance garden which is laid to lawn and patio but has plenty of potential for a keen gardener.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>SITTING/DINING</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>27' 5\" x 13' 11\" (8.36m x 4.24m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BREAKFAST</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>14' 1\" x 10' 11\" (4.29m x 3.33m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ONE</strong>&nbsp;<strong></strong><strong>15' 3\" x 14' 1\" (4.65m x 4.29m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>TWO</strong>&nbsp;<strong>16' 11\" x 13' 6\" (5.16m x 4.11m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>THREE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>14' 6\" x 11' 10\" (4.42m x 3.61m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>FOUR</strong>&nbsp;<strong></strong><strong>10' 11\" x 10' 3\" (3.33m x 3.12m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>FIVE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>7' 2\" x 6' 2\" (2.18m x 1.88m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BATHROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong></strong><strong>6' 4\" x 5' 6\" (1.93m x 1.68m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Externally the home is very striking, classic red brick frontage, large box-bay window and smartly tiled path with wrought-iron fence surround. Stepping inside, this home is well laid out, light and spacious. The front reception with the large bay window, allows the light to flood in and the central fireplace is so typical of these characterful homes. The real wow factor is towards the rear of the property where you will find a large open plan kitchen/dining/family room. The skylights and large expanse of rear windows and doors allows light to flood the room, making it a lovely area to enjoy time in, with the kitchen area providing plenty of room for a range of white goods, cupboards and work-surface space to cook and work in.<br><br>The family bathroom is accessed from the hallway, leaving the first floor with three bedrooms, two of which are good sized doubles with a range of inbuilt storage, and a loft conversion with a double bedroom with en-suite shower room.

Wanstead's thriving High Street boasts a large number of independent café's, bar's restaurants and shops as well as a large number of fantastic schools and transport links. Set on the High Street but separated by a large garden towards the front, this home has the advantage of having everything Wanstead has to offer on your doorstep and is just a short walk from both Snaresbrook (500 feet) and Wanstead Central Line Station (0.4 miles).<br><br>Set back to rear of the plot, this cottage and its approach are the epitome of quintessential English charm - from the pristine green lawn encased by black wrought iron railings, to the sash windows, wooden shutters and weather-boarded exterior. Stepping inside, you immediately enter the dining room with a central fire place and large storage cupboard, which is perfect for shoes and coats or utility items. Leading from the dining room you pass a handy downstairs W.C as you enter into a large, bright contemporary kitchen/breakfast room, which benefits from great deal of natural light thanks to the stunning apex skylight and floor-to-ceiling bi-folding doors. There is a cosy, separate lounge with a central fireplace and a third reception room, which could be used as a study, office or third bedroom depending on your needs. Moving upstairs, the landing provides access to a modern bathroom and two double bedrooms; both enjoying a central fireplace and the master enjoying an en-suite shower room. Both bedrooms have large sash windows making the upstairs feel bright and airy. The property further benefits from secure bike and bin storage towards the front.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>LOUNGE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>13' 11\" x 10' 3\" (4.24m x 3.12m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>DINING</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>16' 10\" x 13' 11\" (5.13m x 4.24m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>KITCHEN/BREAKFAST</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>26' 11\" x 12' 6\" (8.2m x 3.81m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>STUDY/BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>THREE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>11' 1\" x 7' 1\" (3.38m x 2.16m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ONE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>13' 8\" x 10' 5\" (4.17m x 3.18m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BEDROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>TWO</strong>&nbsp;<strong>10' 9\" x 9' 5\" (3.28m x 2.87m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>BATHROOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong>6' 11\" x 6' 7\" (2.11m x 2.01m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>ENSUITE</strong>&nbsp;<strong>6' 6\" x 3' 9\" (1.98m x 1.14m)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Located in the heart of, Wanstead, this enviable location offers everything with an abundance of shops, bars, and eateries, as well as being perfectly placed for both Snaresbrook (0.3 miles) &amp; Wanstead (0.2 miles) Central Line Stations. Internally the property would benefit from some slight refurbishment, but is equally a perfect opportunity for any buyer wishing to add their own personal stamp. The reception is spacious, and offers a bright and airy feel, the kitchen is also very well proportioned and has a range of wall and base units. The bathroom could also be enhanced further with the removal of a storage cupboard that would sit perfectly for a free standing shower, add this to the spacious bedrooms, share of freehold, and residents parking, and we feel this is a fantastic opportunity for any buyer.
